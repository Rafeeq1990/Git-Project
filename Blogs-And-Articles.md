>According to HTML specifications, there are three elements which are supposed to semantically mark up quotations, namely `<blockquote>,` `<q>` and `<cite>`.

>Just like a pull quote blockquote (actually block quotations) are also set off from the main text as a distinct paragraph or block. However, they refer to some external citation which isn’t already mentioned in the article. Block quotations are usually placed within the reader’s flow.
>Finally, “normal” quotes cite the content found in some other sources and are included to support the content rather than dominate over it.
